- Preparing clean data with Excel
- Using Tableau to build interactive dashboards
- Turning data into clear and useful insights

---

### ✅ Conclusion

This project helped me practice real-world data analysis 🧠  
I built a full dashboard showing how COVID-19 spread, affected populations, and how vaccination played a role in recovery 💉
